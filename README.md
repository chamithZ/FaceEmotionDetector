# FaceEmotionDetector

In our project, the primary objective was to harness the potential of Face API JS to develop a system capable of real-time face detection and expression recognition. Leveraging JavaScript and the libraryâ€™s functionalities, we structured the project to interact with the webcam, processing the live feed and providing immediate feedback on detected faces and expressions.
